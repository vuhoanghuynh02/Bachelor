abstract = {Real-world optimization problems often consist of several NP-hard optimization problems that interact with each other. The goal of this paper is to provide a benchmark suite that promotes a research of the interaction between problems and their mutual influence. We establish a comprehensive benchmark suite for the traveling thief problem (TTP) which combines the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem. Our benchmark suite builds on common benchmarks for the two sub-problems which grant a basis to examine the potential hardness imposed by combining the two classical problems. Furthermore, we present some simple heuristics for TTP and their results on our benchmark suite.},

abstract = {This article presents the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. The proposed algorithm implements three novel techniques to enhance the overall performance, lower the execution time and reduce the negative effects particularly connected with ACO-based methods such as falling into a local optimum and issues with settings of control parameters for different instances. These techniques include (a) the node clustering concept where transition nodes are organised in a set of clusters, (b) adaptive pheromone evaporation controlled dynamically based on the information entropy and (c) the formulation of the new termination condition based on the diversity of solutions in population. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed principles, a number of experiments were conducted using 30 benchmark instances (ranging from 51 to 2,392 nodes with various nodes topologies) taken from the well-known TSPLIB benchmarks and the results are compared with several state-of-the-art ACO-based methods; the proposed algorithm outperforms these rival methods in most cases. The impact of the novel techniques on the behaviour of the algorithm is thoroughly analysed and discussed in respect to the overall performance, execution time and convergence.}

abstract = { We consider a special case of the symmetric capacitated vehicle routing problem, in which a fleet of K identical vehicles must serve n customers, each with a given demand consisting in a set of rectangular two-dimensional weighted items. The vehicles have a two-dimensional loading surface and a maximum weight capacity. The aim is to find a partition of the customers into routes of minimum total cost such that, for each vehicle, the weight capacity is taken into account and a feasible two-dimensional allocation of the items into the loading surface exists. The problem has several practical applications in freight transportation, and it is ����-hard in the strong sense. We propose an exact approach, based on a branch-and-cut algorithm, for the minimization of the routing cost that iteratively calls a branch-and-bound algorithm for checking the feasibility of the loadings. Heuristics are also used to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by means of computational results. }

The objective is to minimize both the unused areas of the bins and the sum of weighted earliness and tardiness penalties. This NP hard problem is herein solved using an agent-based approach A-B. The active agents of A-B interact dynamically in real time to jointly fill the bins with items, assign cutting patterns to machines, cut them, and have the items delivered on time. The application of A-B to real life instances from a manufacturing company highlights the sizeable savings induced by A-B, and demonstrates its suitability for complex online real-life situations.",

abstract="Over the past 30 years, many researchers in the field of evolutionary computation have put a lot of effort to introduce various approaches for solving hard problems. Most of these problems have been inspired by major industries so that solving them, by providing either optimal or near optimal solution, was of major significance. Indeed, this was a very promising trajectory as advances in these problem-solving approaches could result in adding values to major industries. In this chapter, we revisit this trajectory to find out whether the attempts that started three decades ago are still aligned with the same goal, as complexities of real-world problems increased significantly. We present some examples of modern real-world problems, discuss why they might be difficult to solve, and whether there is any mismatch between these examples and the problems that are investigated in the evolutionary computation area.",

The CMA was originally designed to perform well with small populations. In this review, the argument starts out with large population sizes, reflecting recent extensions of the CMA algorithm. Commonalities and differences to continuous Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are analyzed. The aspects of reliability of the estimation, overall step size control, and independence from the coordinate system (invariance) become particularly important in small populations sizes. Consequently, performing the adaptation task with small populations is more intricate.",

abstract = {Ant System, the first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, showed to be a viable method for attacking hard combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, its performance, when compared to more fine-tuned algorithms, was rather poor for large instances of traditional benchmark problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. To show that Ant Colony Optimization algorithms could be good alternatives to existing algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization problems, recent research in this area has mainly focused on the development of algorithmic variants which achieve better performance than Ant System. In this paper, we present MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS), an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm derived from Ant System. MMAS differs from Ant System in several important aspects, whose usefulness we demonstrate by means of an experimental study. Additionally, we relate one of the characteristics specific to MMAS — that of using a greedier search than Ant System — to results from the search space analysis of the combinatorial optimization problems attacked in this paper. Our computational results on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Quadratic Assignment Problem show that MMAS is currently among the best performing algorithms for these problems.}

abstract = {Research on a new metaheuristic for optimization is often initially focused on proof-of-concept applications. It is only after experimental work has shown the practical interest of the method that researchers try to deepen their understanding of the method's functioning not only through more and more sophisticated experiments but also by means of an effort to build a theory. Tackling questions such as “how and why the method works’’ is important, because finding an answer may help in improving its applicability. Ant colony optimization, which was introduced in the early 1990s as a novel technique for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, finds itself currently at this point of its life cycle. With this article we provide a survey on theoretical results on ant colony optimization. First, we review some convergence results. Then we discuss relations between ant colony optimization algorithms and other approximate methods for optimization. Finally, we focus on some research efforts directed at gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of ant colony optimization algorithms. Throughout the paper we identify some open questions with a certain interest of being solved in the near future.}

The problem consists of a set of cities, each containing a set of available items with weights and profits. It involves searching for a permutation of the cities to visit and a decision on items to pick. A selected item contributes its profit to the overall profit at the price of higher transportation cost incurred by its weight. The objective is to maximize the resulting profit. We propose a number of problem-specific packing strategies run on top of TSP solutions derived by the Chained Lin-Kernighan heuristic. The investigations provided on the set of benchmark instances prove their rapidity and efficiency when compared with an approximate mixed integer programming based approach and state-of-the-art heuristic solutions from the literature.},
